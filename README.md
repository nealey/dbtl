Dirtbags Tiny Linux
=================

This is a dockerfile that builds a minimal forensic analysis environment
suitable for the network archaeology track of Cyber Fire.

I created this in August of 2017,
after my laptop crashed,
and I needed a quick way to use a Chromebook and remote CoreOS Container Linux server.

This bundles the following helpful utilites
on top of an Alpine linux base:

* less
* vim
* git
* file
* tcpdump
* tcpflow
* complete gcc build environment
* fluffy suite
* ... and more! *

It may actually be quicker and easier to just read the dockerfile.

\* there may not actually be any more.
